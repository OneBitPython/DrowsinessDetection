# DrowsinessDetection

This project, uses CV(computer vison and the opencv library to find drowsiness in people. There are two main files in this project, the main.py file and the sleepiness.py file
Both of these files use your camera to detect whether you feel drowsy or not.
The main.py file searches for drowsiness in your eyes, like when you close your eyes, or when you are about to sleep. The sleepiness.py file searches for whenever you are going to yawn.

## setup
To setup the project, all you need to do is download the respository, extract it, go to that directory and then say ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. Then you can either run the main.py file or the sleepiness.py file
